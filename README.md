Adwaitapod is a modern, feature-rich UI for Apple iPod classic models 5th thru 7th generations. Designed around the GNOME Foundation's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/index.html), adwaitapod aims to deliver a clean, consistant user experience that can be customised to fit your tastes and needs. Available in two variations, classic and simplified, both come in either light or dark mode with extra fonts and wallpapers available.

This Ui theme makes use of the Cantarell font, alongside the adwaita icon set. Noto Sans CJK is used to provide CJK font support.

 **All extras can be found in the releases section to the side.**
