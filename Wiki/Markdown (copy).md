## Introduction

 Adwaitapod is an advanced, feature-rich theme for iPod classics 5th, 6th and 7th gen. Built using rockbox, and designed following the GNOME Foundation's Human Interface Guidelines, adaitapod seeks to provide the best user experience possible on an iPod. 

 This new, third version has been rebuilt from scratch to massively improve RAM usage, performance and total file size. These technical improvements paved the way for the ambitious redesign that has a plethora of new features and many redesigned elements. At it's core, adwaitapod 3.0 is familiar for long time users, and extremely inviting for new users.

 The user manual exists as the ultimate reference for users. This manual is full of information about every part of adwaitapod, and how to get the most out of it. There is also detailed guides on installing extra features, and tweaking the theme to be truly yours. 

 Adwaitapod 3.0 has taken an enormous amount of work, and it would not have been possible without the feedback of users, friends and so on. If you have enjoyed using adwaitapod, please do consider leaving a tip on my Ko-Fi, it helps make themes like this possible.
