## Advanced Operations

### Installing Extra Fonts

[ image of extra fonts ]

While the default language pack only supports Latin characters, through additional language packs users can extend the supported character range of adwaitapod. 

Asian character sets for Simplified Chinese, Korean and Japanese can be installed alongside Cyrillic and extended Unicode characters in the Extra Language pack. Other languages may be supported in the future if requested by users.

To install, download the font pack from the Releases section on Github, extract and then drop the .rockbox folder into your iPod's directory. Merge the folders. On your iPod, you may need to refresh the theme. You can do this by going to the theme selection and re-selecting adwaitapod. 

[ image of larger fonts ]

For users who find the default menu fonts too small, larger fonts can also be added for menus. These are supported by adwaitapod's rounded corner system, and the pack includes files for this. The larger font packs are installed the same way as the extra language pack.

### Installing Extra Wallpapers

[ image of extra wallpapers ]
